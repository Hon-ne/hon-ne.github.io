We discovered ingredients in the dorm kitchen and used some of those, too.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWe made chocolate chip and oatmeal trail mix cookies. We also experimented and made cookies with interesting ingredient combinations for fun: chocolate and chili powder, butterscotch and vanilla, and even a few with all of our ingredients.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nThe whole process was five hours from start to finish. Our first batch of chocolate chip cookies didn’t turn out so well: we added too many chocolate chunks, which made the cookies too soft and impossible to pick up without crumbling. The first oatmeal cookies were also too big.\n\nHowever, we learned from our initial mistakes and the remaining batches turned out a little better (with the exception of the third batch of oatmeal cookies, which we left in the oven too long and burned).\n\n\n\t\n\n\nAt about the one-hour mark, both of us started feeling nauseous from the overwhelmingly sweet scent of cookie dough, but we persevered and kept baking cookies until we ran out of dough.\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWe gave away almost all of the cookies. Seeing smiles and hearing praises from friends made it all worthwhile!\n\n\n\nI don’t know about Emmy, but I think I’ve had enough cookies to satisfy me for a couple months.\n\n(Photos courtesy of my Snapchat friends, you’re welcome for the cookies)\n","excerpt":"Emmy and I made cookies for Valentine’s Day! 🍪\n\n","languages":null,"categories":["misc"],"tags":["food"]},{"title":"Badminton 101","permalink":"http://hon-ne.me/badminton-101.html","link":"http://hon-ne.me/badminton-101.html","date":"2016-02-13T20:53:00-05:00","modified":"2016-02-21T10:09:03-05:00","author":{"name":"Dan Zheng","url":"http://danzheng.me","email":"zheng321@purdue.edu"},"content":"Badminton is a fun sport enjoyed by people all over the world. The objective is simple: to hit the shuttle with your racket so that it passes over the net and lands inside your opponent’s half of the court. When this happens, you win a rally and get a point; get enough points and you win the match.\n\nYour opponent has the same goal as you: he or she will try to reach the shuttle and hit it over the net into your half of the court. If your opponent makes a mistake and hits the shuttle into the net or out of bounds, you win the rally. If you make a mistake, your opponent wins the point.\n\n\n\nThere are many types of shots in badminton. The type of shot you can make depends on your position in the court, specifically your distance from the net.\n\n\n  Rear court\n    \n      Clear:\n      Drop:\n    \n  \n  Mid-court\n    \n      Drive:\n      Smash:\n    \n  \n  Net\n    \n      Net shot:\n      Net kill:\n    \n  \n\n\nThere are two simple rules of thumb about making high quality shots:\n\n\n  Overhead forehand is better than overhead backhand.\n    \n      Overhead forehand shots are generally favored over overhead backhand shots. It is easier to generate power with the forehand and it is generally easier to recover from playing a overhead forehand shot because overhead backhand shots require you to turn your body.\n      That’s why many professional players can be seen playing around-the-head forehand shots, which they use to hit the shuttle when it is on their backhand side using their forehand.\n    \n  \n  Higher/sooner is better than lower/later.\n\n\nin progress\n","excerpt":"Badminton is a fun sport enjoyed by people all over the world.
